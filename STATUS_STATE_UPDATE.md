## üìù **Implementation Notes**

### **Technical Approach**
- Following existing patterns in codebase
- Using established `invoke<CommandResult<T>>` pattern
- Maintaining TypeScript type safety
- Following shadcn/ui component patterns

### **Quality Standards**
- All lint checks must pass: `npm run lint`
- All format checks must pass: `npm run format:check`
- All Rust checks must pass: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
- All tests must pass: `npm test`, `cargo test`

### **Architecture Decisions**
- Extending existing pages rather than creating new ones where possible
- Using existing state management patterns
- Following established error handling with toast notifications
- Maintaining consistent UI/UX patterns

## üîÑ **Next Steps (Phase 5 Continuation)**

1. **Fix realtime_optimizer.rs placeholder functions** (IN PROGRESS)
